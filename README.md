# First project of the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree
## Facial keypoint detection using a CNN

This project uses a CNN to predict 68 facial keypoints. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. 

## Example

Below you can see an example of the position of the numbered keypoints.

The pretrained CNN was trained with the [YouTube faces DB](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/)
